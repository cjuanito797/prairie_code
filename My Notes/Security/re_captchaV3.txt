So one of the things that I need to begin adding to all of my websites that I
engineer would be that of a re-captcha. Specifically v3, where the user does not
need to worry about entering text presented to them in a squiggly format or
have to worry about clicking all the images for the traffic lights.

This can definitely be something that we can make a YouTube video about. So we
need to add the widget to our HTML code, and in our view we need to add the
python logic in order to validate the form, with the recaptcha in play.

Also because we are linking our domain name, this might not be something we may
be able to test in production.
