                        with a platform such as
                        SquareSpace, WordPress or even Shopify?</p>

                <p class="text">The reason we believe in our services and end-product versus these other platforms, is
                    because eventually you will find it very difficult to grow your online business within the
                    constraints of their platforms. Here at Prairie Code we do not partner with platforms to build our
                    services. We utilize fundamental web technologies that allow us to build out your system and scale
                    it. Ask yourself, which truly succesful businesses are constrained within a shopify or WordPress
                    platform?</p>
